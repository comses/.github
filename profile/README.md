# CoMSES Net: The Network for Computational Modeling in the Social and Ecological Sciences

CoMSES Net, the Network for Computational Modeling in the Social and Ecological Sciences, is an international research network dedicated to advancing the interdisciplinary science of the complexly interacting social and natural processes critical to human life and well-being. Computational models are integral scientific tools to understand these coupled social-natural systems by providing adaptive, evidence-based scenarios of possible future conditions for planning and policymaking. These models can range from simple demonstrations of emergent behavior (e.g., flocking behavior of birds) to millions of lines of software source code implementing complex equation-based models that explore the interactions between earth, atmospheric, and ocean systems. 

CoMSES formed in 2007 as a result of a community-driven planning workshop supported by the US National Science Foundation. Since then, the CoMSES Net team has been working alongside community partners and open science pioneers to develop digital research infrastructure that improves the ways we design, develop and share the computational models that underpin research findings - to make them more [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x) and more transparent, accessible, understandable, interoperable, and reusable. 

Our mission is to promote knowledge sharing among scientists and the general public around the world, and to support open, transparent, access to community curated information resources that bring innovations and best practices from the open science community and the rapidly evolving software industry to scientists and researchers who specialize in earth and social systems science.
